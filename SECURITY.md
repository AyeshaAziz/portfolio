# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This project implements comprehensive security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication Security
- **Environment-based credentials**: Set `VITE_AUTH_USERNAME` and `VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variables
- **Rate limiting**: Progressive delays for failed login attempts
- **Input validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Session management**: Automatic session timeout after 30 minutes

### 2. Input Protection
- **Input sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized using DOMPurify
- **Schema validation**: Zod schemas validate input format and length
- **XSS prevention**: React's built-in XSS protection + input sanitization

### 3. Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts resource loading
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Browser XSS protection
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Progressive delays**: Exponential backoff for failed attempts
- **Client-side rate limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
- **Automatic reset**: Rate limits reset after successful login

### 5. Security Monitoring
- **Security event logging**: All security events are logged
- **Session monitoring**: Automatic session validation
- **Security context**: Centralized security management

## Environment Variables

Set these environment variables for production:

```bash
VITE_AUTH_USERNAME=your_username
VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials** to version control
2. **Use HTTPS** in production
3. **Regular security updates** for dependencies
4. **Monitor security logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Set strong credentials** in production environment

## Production Deployment

1. Set environment variables in your deployment platform
2. Enable HTTPS/SSL certificates
3. Configure additional security headers at the server level
4. Set up monitoring and alerting for security events
5. Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Rate Limiting Details

- **Max attempts**: 5 failed attempts before rate limiting
- **Progressive delays**: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 15min (exponential backoff)
- **Reset condition**: Successful login resets the counter
- **Cooldown period**: 15 minutes maximum delay

## Security Monitoring

The application logs the following security events:
- Login attempts (successful and failed)
- Rate limiting triggers
- Input validation failures
- Session timeouts
- Security configuration changes

## Browser Compatibility

Security features are compatible with:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Support
